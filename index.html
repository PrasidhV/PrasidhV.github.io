  <p class="w3-center"><em>What is Hydroponics</em></p>
  <p>The Oxford Dictionary defines <b>Hydroponics</b> as <i>"the process of growing plants in sand, gravel, liquid with added nutrients but without soil."</i> </p>
        <p>Hydroponics does not use soil. However, the root system requires to be supported by medium. Some commonly used medium is Coco-peat, Clay Pellets, Rock Wool and in some cases various sized pebbles. The sole purpose of the medium is to provide mechanical support. The nutrients required by the plant are directly added to the water that is taken in by the roots. Almost all plants can be grown through various types of Hydroponics </p>

   <p class="w3-center"><em>Types of Hydroponics</em></p>
   <p>There are 6 basic types of Hydroponic systems. All the variations are developed from any one or a combination of these systems.</p>
  
   <p>The Wick System is the simplest Hydroponic System. A growth tray and a growing medium with plants is mounted on a reservoir with nutrient solution. The nutrient solution is drawn up from the reservoir using wicks.</p>

    <div class="w3-col m6 w3-hide-small w3-padding-large">
  
<p>The Water Culture System is basically consists of a floating platform that is made in such a way that it holds the plants directly over the nutrient solution in a reservoir. This is comparatively a less expensive method of Hydroponics. Water loving plants like Lettuce can be ideally grown using this system.</p>

   <p>The Flood and Drain system is also called as Ebb and Flow System. As the name suggests the growing tray is temperately flooded with the nutrient solution. The solution is then drained into the reservoir. This alternation of flooding and draining has to be controlled in a rhythmic manner by using a timer and a pump that is submerged in the reservoir.</p>
